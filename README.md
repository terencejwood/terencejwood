## Hi there 👋
# Terence J. Wood

FinTech + Business Analysis + Risk + Process Improvement  
I build analytics products: SQL data models, risk metrics, dashboards, and operational reporting.

## What I’m building
- Fraud & chargeback risk scoring (rules + explainability)
- PCI-style compliance evidence reporting (controls → evidence → dashboards)
- Credit/underwriting decisioning simulation (policy + reason codes)
- Financial risk early-warning watchlists (ratios + trend alerts)
- Process mining for operations (cycle time, rework, SLA breaches)

## Tech
SQL (SQL Server) • Power BI • Python/R • Git/GitHub • Data Modeling • Risk Reporting • Controls & Compliance

## Portfolio (pinned)
See my pinned repositories below for end-to-end projects (data → logic → dashboard → documentation).
